## META-NARRATIVE 1: "THE TAMRAGHT EXPERIMENT"

### Internal Narrative Description
We're launching the first retreat at Reda's brand-new luxury riad—a fresh spot on Tamraght's surf map. We know surf works. We know AI works (Iwo's proven it for founders, productivity, life organization). What we don't know yet: what happens when you combine them for a week with the right people. We're inviting 20 people to help us find out.

### Catchy Headline/Hook
**"We're testing something: Surf + AI + 20 founders in a brand-new Moroccan riad. Want in?"**

### Marketing Description (1-2 sentences)
We're launching the first retreat at our friend Reda's luxury riad in Tamraght—an undiscovered gem on Morocco's surf coast. Help us figure out what happens when you combine daily surfing, AI tools, and a curated group of builders for 7 days.

### Who Is It For?
- Curious founders who like experiments
- People who want to shape something from the beginning
- Early adopters who value being "first"
- Anyone intrigued by surf + work intersection
- Builders who see potential in AI but need practical application

### Why This Works
- **Experimental framing** = lower barrier (not claiming to have all answers)
- **First cohort appeal** = exclusivity without pretension
- **Co-discovery** = participants feel ownership
- **Reda's new riad** = you're discovering a place before it's on everyone's map
- **AI versatility** = speaks to different needs without being too niche
- **FOMO** = "be there when something new is born"

### Vibe
Exploratory, optimistic, transparent, collaborative, "let's figure this out together"

### Specific UVPs (3-5 bullet points)

- **First-ever retreat at Reda's brand-new luxury riad** — Discover Tamraght's newest surf spot before the crowds do (inside/outside pools, rooftop terraces, the best Moroccan food you've never heard of)

- **Daily surf coaching on world-class Moroccan waves** — All levels welcome. Reda's been surfing here his whole life. You'll catch waves. Guaranteed.

- **AI tools that actually solve your problems** — Iwo (non-technical AI expert) shows you how to use AI for what you need: managing your business, organizing chaos, building systems that stick, or just staying sane as a founder

- **Shape the first version** — Your input determines what we build next. First cohort = founding members who help define what this becomes

- **20 carefully selected people** — We're curating for chemistry, not credentials. Apply with what you're curious about, what you want to explore

## META-NARRATIVE 2: "THE UNDISCOVERED TAMRAGHT"

### Internal Narrative Description
Everyone goes to Taghazout. But 15 minutes away, there's Tamraght—quieter, more authentic, better waves, and now: Reda's luxury riad that nobody knows about yet. We're using it as a base to create something that doesn't exist: a space where surf culture meets builder culture, where AI isn't abstract tech but a practical tool for the life you're actually living. This is about discovering a place—and discovering what's possible there.

### Catchy Headline/Hook
**"While everyone surfs Taghazout, we found something better 15 minutes away."**

### Marketing Description (1-2 sentences)
Reda just opened a luxury riad in Tamraght—the quiet surf village everyone will discover in 2 years. We're inviting 20 founders to experience it first: world-class waves, AI tools for real life, and the space to figure out what you're actually building.

### Who Is It For?
- Founders who pride themselves on finding things first
- People tired of overrun, touristy spots
- Insiders who value authentic experiences
- Builders looking for clarity away from noise
- Anyone who wants the "before it was cool" story

### Why This Works
- **Insider knowledge** = "we know something you don't"
- **Anti-tourism positioning** = appeals to sophisticated travelers
- **Reda's local credibility** = authentic vs. imported experience
- **Place discovery + self-discovery** = double transformation
- **Timing urgency** = "Tamraght won't stay quiet forever"
- **Status signaling** = "I was there first"

### Vibe
Insider, sophisticated, discovery-oriented, slightly secretive, "you're early"

### Specific UVPs (3-5 bullet points)

- **Tamraght's best-kept secret: Reda's brand-new riad** — While Taghazout gets crowded, we found the real Morocco 15 minutes away. Luxury accommodation (inside/outside pools, ocean-view terraces), authentic Berber village, world-class surf without the circus

- **Surf the waves locals surf** — Reda knows every break, every tide, every secret spot. You're not a tourist here. You're learning from someone who grew up on these waves

- **AI tools designed for founders, not engineers** — Iwo translates AI from Silicon Valley hype into actual tools you'll use: organize your scattered ideas, automate what drains you, build systems that match how your brain works (whether that's ADHD, overwhelm, or just too many projects)

- **Discover what you're building (the business and yourself)** — 7 days away from the noise. Daily surf for clarity. Workshops when you need them. Conversations with people building real things. Space to think

- **First 20 people get the founder rate** — We're testing pricing, gathering feedback, building the model. You help shape it. Future cohorts pay more

## META-NARRATIVE 3: "OCEAN + AI"

### Internal Narrative Description
Ancient wisdom: the ocean teaches patience, reading conditions, commitment, letting go. Modern tool: AI helps you capture ideas, prioritize ruthlessly, automate the repetitive, think clearer. What if you spent a week learning both? Reda's opening a new riad in Tamraght. Iwo knows AI inside-out (non-technical, practical). We're combining them for 20 founders who want to work smarter and live better.

### Catchy Headline/Hook
**"The ocean teaches you patience. AI teaches you speed. Learn both in 7 days."**

### Marketing Description (1-2 sentences)
Spend a week in Reda's brand-new Moroccan surf riad learning two skills: how to surf (presence, patience, reading conditions) and how to use AI (productivity, organization, clarity). Same principles, different mediums—both transform how you work.

### Who Is It For?
- Founders balancing urgency and patience
- People seeking "work smarter, not harder" solutions
- Anyone curious about AI but overwhelmed by technical noise
- Builders who value both ancient wisdom and modern tools
- Surf-curious people who see it as more than sport

### Why This Works
- **Contrast creates intrigue** = ancient vs. modern, slow vs. fast
- **Two transformations for one price** = surf skills + AI skills
- **Philosophical depth** = appeals to thoughtful builders
- **Balances tech and nature** = antidote to pure digital life
- **Practical + poetic** = both functional and meaningful
- **AI made accessible** = Iwo as bridge from hype to utility

### Vibe
Philosophical, balanced, wise, practical-meets-poetic, "integrated life"

### Specific UVPs (3-5 bullet points)

- **Surf as leadership training** — Reading waves teaches you to read markets. Commitment teaches you to execute. Wiping out teaches you resilience. Reda coaches you through all of it at his brand-new luxury riad in Tamraght (Morocco's quieter surf village with world-class breaks)

- **AI as your "second brain"** — Iwo (non-technical AI expert) shows you how AI actually helps founders: capture every idea without forgetting, prioritize what matters, automate repetitive work, organize your chaos (especially if you have ADHD or 10 projects running simultaneously)

- **Same principles, different mediums** — Ocean: wait, watch, commit, let go. AI: capture, process, execute, release. Both teach presence and power. You'll learn both in 7 days

- **Brand-new luxury base** — Reda's riad just opened: inside pool, outside pool, rooftop terraces overlooking the ocean, the best Moroccan cuisine in the area. You're among the first to experience it

- **20 founders figuring it out together** — Curated group. Real conversations. Peer learning. No gurus, no bullshit. Just builders helping builders work better and surf better

## RECOMMENDATION

### Top Pick: **NARRATIVE 1 ("THE TAMRAGHT EXPERIMENT")**

**Why:**
1. **Lowest barrier to entry** — "We're testing" is less intimidating than "We have the answer"
2. **Strongest co-creation angle** — Invites participation in research/discovery
3. **Most flexible** — Doesn't lock you into one philosophy or positioning
4. **Authenticity** — Matches where you actually are (first cohort, figuring it out)
5. **FOMO without pretension** — First cohort appeal without claiming perfection
6. **AI versatility showcased** — Mentions multiple use cases naturally
7. **Reda's riad naturally introduced** — "brand-new" creates urgency without hype
