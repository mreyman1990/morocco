## Risk Management

### Potential Blockers:
1. **Can't decide on persona**: Use scoring matrix. If tied, go with Iwo's AI Bootcamp (strongest network).
2. **Reda doesn't respond**: Follow up Monday, November 18. Have backup venues researched.
3. **Landing page tech issues**: Use simplest tool (Carrd or Google Forms + Google Sites).
4. **Narrative feels flat**: Get external feedback from 2-3 trusted friends by Thursday.

### Contingency Plan:
- If we're behind by Wednesday evening, deprioritize visual mood board and social media prep
- Focus on: Persona decision → Reda proposal → Landing page live
- Everything else can shift to week of November 18

---

## Next Week Preview (November 18-24)

Assuming this week goes well, next week we'll focus on:

1. **Reda Partnership Finalization**: Video call, negotiate terms, sign agreement
2. **Expert/Trainer Outreach**: Begin conversations with 3-5 potential workshop leaders
3. **Acquisition Launch**: Start promoting waitlist page through personal networks
4. **Content Creation**: Produce 2-3 high-quality posts/videos about the retreat concept
5. **Community Building**: Set up private Slack or WhatsApp group for early interest signups

---

## Motivational Reminder

**We're 16 weeks away from March 2026.**

This week is the foundation. The decisions we make now will determine whether we're scrambling in January or confidently filling our retreat in December.

**Let's lock in our niche, tell a compelling story, and get Reda on board.**

**Yalla yalla! 🏄‍♂️🇲🇦**
