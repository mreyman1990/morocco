**NARRATIVE 1:** 

**"THREE FRIENDS, UNIQUE ALLIGEMENT, ONE MISSION"**

**HOOK:**

**Three friends. One new riad. Your co-designed SURF+AI Immersion Retreat.**

**DESCRIPTION:**

Sometimes things just align./Sometimes timing is everything.

In 2022, two lads went for their first surf trip to Morocco and met Reda, who grew up on these waves. They fell in love with the vibe, the people and kept coming back.

Three years and many surf trips later…

Iwo teaches AI to non-technical people.  
Michał left tech and entered the hospitality industry.  
Reda just opened the biggest luxury surf riad in the Taghazout/Tarmaght area.

The opportunity is obvious. 

We are organizing an invite-only **SURF+AI Immersion Retreat** for people who build things (with or without code). And we're asking them to co-design the experience of the first cohort. 

Here's the outline:

**Locked in:**

* Daily surf (all levels welcome) and yoga  
* Luxury base (inside pool, outside pool, en-suite rooms, rooftop terraces  
* AI workshops (practical, non-technical)  
* Exploring Moroccan culture, places, nature, and food

**Co-created by you:**

* Focus on the hands-on skills that matter most to your life and work  
* Providing the transformation you are looking for   
* Finding the right kind of people you want to connect with

Your input shapes the program. Tell us what you need \- we'll design the week around it.

Let’s build\!

**DETAILS:**

Date: 20-27 March 2026  
Place: Tamraght \- the surfing capital of Morocco

**ANGLE 2: neurodivergency-focused. Turn your ADHD into a superpower with SURF and AI**

**HOOK:** 

**The ocean gives you clarity. AI gives you speed.**  
**Learn both in 7 days and harness your ADHD.**

**DESCRIPTION:**

Surfing clears your mind, teaches patience, commitment, and letting go.  
AI helps capture ideas, prioritize, organize, and think more clearly.

What if you learned both in a luxury environment, surrounded by a vetted group of people who get you?

We are creating a neurodivergent-friendly, invite-only **SURF+AI Immersion retreat** in Morocco. And looking for extraordinary individuals to help us design the program.

Do you want to...

1. Turn your ADHD into a real superpower with the help of AI?   
2. Build an AI-powered second brain to help you cope with work and personal life?  
3. Meet like-minded people to surf, learn and connect?

Or you are after something different?

We (Michał and Iwo) know you have powerful ideas. We’re both neurodivergends lads who like to build stuff while dealing with our scattered minds.

Let’s join forces \- ahare the vision of your perfect experience and shape the first cohort of **SURF+AI Immersion**.
