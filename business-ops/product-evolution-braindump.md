# Product Evolution - Brain Dump

## The Problem: Too Many Angles

Initially, we considered various specific retreat angles:
- Surfing + AI workshops
- Surfing for ADHD/neurodivergent people
- Surfing + creation (painting, collage, jewelry making)
- Surfing + meditation
- Surfing + cooking
- Surfing + dating/relation building

**Issue:** This approach was too fragmented and unclear.

## Potential Paying Customer Groups

We identified groups that could afford our premium pricing (€1500/week):

- Founders from PL/Europe
- Tech enthusiasts from Saudi Arabia
- High-paid professionals (lawyers, architects, etc.)
- Software developers
- Remote workers, ex-digital nomads
- Neurodivergent founders and managers
- Biohackers, productivity freaks

**Key insight:** These groups can overlap (e.g., a founder from Saudi Arabia who is a productivity freak)

**Additional filter:** Should also overlap with people who either:
- Already surf, OR
- Want to learn to surf (identifiable as people who like: staying active, adventures, outdoors, yoga, longevity, water sports)

**Result:** Still quite a mess. Not clear how to target and build the offer.

## NEW APPROACH: Co-Creation Model

**Core decision: Let the people tell us what they want!**

- A surf and yoga retreat
