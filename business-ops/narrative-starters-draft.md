# Narrative Starters - Draft Versions
**Created:** November 12, 2024
**Purpose:** 4 versions to review with Iwo on Friday
**Target:** Founders, ADHD entrepreneurs, remote workers, biohackers
**Deadline:** Send to Iwo Thursday

---

## VERSION 1: FOUNDER BURNOUT ANGLE
**Tone:** Empathetic, understanding, renewal-focused
**Target:** Burned-out founders who feel isolated

### The Narrative:

Last year, we both hit the same wall.

Iwo was running on fumes after years of building. I was drowning in productivity hacks that didn't actually work. We realized something: the loneliness of building isn't about being alone—it's about being surrounded by people who don't get it.

So we flew to Morocco to visit our friend Reda. He was opening a new luxury riad in Tamraght—a Berber fishing village with some of the best waves in North Africa. We spent a week learning to surf, eating incredible food on rooftop terraces, and rebuilding our systems from scratch.

**Here's what the ocean taught us:** You can't force a wave. You wait, you watch, you paddle when the moment's right. Then you stand up and ride.

Surfing became our therapy. No phones in the water. No productivity guilt. Just presence, challenge, and the reset we both desperately needed.

It changed everything.

Now Reda's riad is ready. And we're inviting 20 founders to join us for the first retreat.

**7 days in Tamraght:**
- **Surf every morning** (all levels welcome—we'll teach you)
- **Build your AI-powered second brain** (actual systems, not theory)
- **Connect with founders who get it** (peer hot seats, real conversations)
- **Luxury accommodation** (Reda's brand-new riad: inside pool, ocean-view terraces, the best Moroccan cuisine in the area)

**This isn't another networking event.** It's three friends creating the space we wish existed when we were burning out. Waves, systems, and people who understand.

**Limited to 20 spots.** Applications required. We're vetting for fit, not credentials.

**→ Apply here** [Interactive form with AI matching]

*Tamraght is a 15-minute drive from touristy Taghazout. Think: quieter beaches, authentic surf culture, and people who actually came to connect, not perform.*

## VERSION 2: ADHD/NEURODIVERGENT ANGLE
**Tone:** Knowing, insider, "finally, people who get it"
**Target:** ADHD entrepreneurs, neurodivergent founders

### The Narrative:

If you're reading this, you probably have 47 tabs open right now.

We do too.

I'm Michał. My brain moves faster than my systems can keep up. I've tried every productivity framework designed for neurotypical people. They don't work.

Iwo gets it. His ADHD brain is why he's great at building—and why traditional "focus" advice feels like a foreign language.

Then we discovered something unexpected: **Surfing is ADHD therapy.**

In the water, you can't multitask. You can't check your phone. Your entire nervous system focuses on one thing: the next wave. It's the most natural flow state training we've ever experienced.

Our friend Reda—who's been surfing Moroccan waves his whole life—just opened a luxury riad in Tamraght. We're partnering with him to create the retreat we wish existed.

**7 days for 20 neurodivergent founders:**

**Surf every day (coached for all levels):**
- Body regulation through ocean immersion
- Flow state training on actual waves
- ADHD-friendly movement (no boring gym workouts)
- Dopamine hits from catching waves, not scrolling

**Build systems that work for your brain:**
- AI-powered second brain (designed for ADHD thinking)
- Capture → Process → Execute (not another system you'll abandon)
- Learn from peers who think like you

**The space:**
- Reda's brand-new luxury riad (inside + outside pools, rooftop terraces)
- The best Moroccan food you'll ever eat
- Quiet village, world-class surf, 15 min from Taghazout chaos

**The structure:** Short workshops (we get bored too). Lots of breaks. Movement between sessions. Real conversations with people who jump between topics.

**Limited to 20 people.** Applications required. We're building the group you've been looking for.

**→ Apply here** [Tell us about your brain, your business, what you need]

*10% of entrepreneurs have ADHD vs. 4% of general population. You're not broken. You're just surrounded by the wrong people.*

## VERSION 3: BUILDER/CREATOR ANGLE
**Tone:** Ambitious, energetic, optimistic, action-oriented
**Target:** High-output creators, serial builders, productivity enthusiasts

### The Narrative:

Too many ideas. Not enough systems.

Sound familiar?

I'm Michał. I build things. So does Iwo. We're the kind of people who have three side projects, five half-finished courses, and a notes app that's basically a graveyard of brilliant ideas.

The problem isn't ideas. It's capture. It's prioritization. It's building a system that actually keeps up with how fast our brains move.

**We cracked it using AI + second brain methodology.**

Then we realized something else: **Surfing is the perfect physical metaphor for building.**

You have to read the conditions. Choose your wave. Commit fully. Wipe out sometimes. Get back on the board. Momentum compounds. It's exactly how great products get built—except you're doing it in the Atlantic Ocean.

Our friend Reda (lifelong surfer, hospitality expert) just opened a luxury riad in Tamraght. We're partnering to create 7 days where you build two things: your second brain, and your surf skills.

**What we're building together:**

**Systems (mental momentum):**
- AI-powered second brain from scratch
- Capture → Process → Execute (actual workflow, not theory)
- Habit design for high-output creators
- Hot seat sessions for your biggest bottleneck

**Surf (physical momentum):**
- Daily surf coaching (all levels—beginners welcome)
- Learn to read waves, pick your moment, commit
- Build the confidence that comes from challenging yourself physically
- Flow state training that translates directly to your work

**Community:**
- 20 builders who operate at your speed
- Peer accountability that actually works
- Real conversations over Reda's incredible Moroccan cooking

**The space:**
- Brand-new luxury riad in quiet Tamraght
- Inside pool, ocean-view terraces, rooftop workspace
- World-class surf spot, 15 min from Taghazout crowds
- The best food you'll eat in Morocco

**This is for you if:**
- You have more ideas than time
- You want systems, not motivation
- You're ready to challenge yourself (in water and work)
- You're building something that matters

**Limited to 20 people.** First cohort. Founding members. Applications open.

**→ Apply here** [What are you building? What's your bottleneck?]

*We're selecting for ambition, not achievement. Show us you're serious.*

## VERSION 4: CO-CREATION/EXPERIMENTAL ANGLE
**Tone:** Collaborative, transparent, experimental, invitational
**Target:** People who want agency, hate generic solutions

### The Narrative:

We're building a retreat. You can help design it.

Here's the honest truth: Iwo and I have been to enough "founder retreats" to know what's wrong with them.

They're generic. One-size-fits-all. You pay €1,500 to sit through workshops you didn't ask for, led by people who don't know your actual problems.

**So we're doing something different.**

Our friend Reda just opened a luxury riad in Tamraght—a quiet surf village in Morocco with world-class waves. The three of us are using it as an experimental space for the first retreat we actually want to attend.

**Here's what's locked in:**

**Surfing every day (coached, all levels):**
- Reda's been surfing these waves his whole life—he'll teach you
- Morning sessions before your brain gets cluttered
- Afternoon sessions when you need to reset
- You'll catch waves. We guarantee it.

**The space (luxury):**
- Reda's brand-new riad (inside pool, outside pool, rooftop terraces)
- The best Moroccan food you'll eat (Reda's family recipes)
- Quiet village, authentic culture, 15 min from Taghazout
- Ocean-view workspace for when inspiration hits

**7 days. 20 people. No phones in the water.**

**Here's what's NOT locked in:**

The content. That's where you come in.

**How this works:**

**1. You apply** → Tell us what you're struggling with
   - Building AI systems for your work?
   - Managing ADHD as a founder?
   - Creating peer accountability?
   - Productivity systems that actually stick?
   - Something else entirely?

**2. We match the group** → AI-powered form finds overlapping needs
   - 20 people with shared challenges
   - Diverse backgrounds, common struggles
   - Curated for chemistry

**3. We co-create the agenda** → Group decides workshop focus
   - Vote on topics that matter to YOU
   - Request specific experts from our network
   - Every session is something the group asked for

**This is an experiment.** We're building in public. The surf is the anchor. Everything else, we design together.

You're not a customer—you're a founding member.

**€1,500.** Limited to 20 spots. First cohort.

**→ Apply here** [What do you need? What will you bring?]

*P.S. If this works, we'll do it again. You'll help shape the next one too. And Reda's riad becomes the home base for a new kind of founder community.*

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FRIDAY DISCUSSION

### Strongest Elements Across All Versions:

1. **Surfing as central transformation tool** (not just an activity)
   - V1: Ocean therapy, presence, letting go
   - V2: ADHD flow state training (strongest integration) ⭐
   - V3: Physical metaphor for building momentum
   - V4: The guaranteed foundation, everything else flexible

2. **Three friends story (You + Iwo + Reda)**
   - Personal connection, not corporate retreat company
   - Reda's authentic local expertise + new luxury riad
   - "Creating the space we wish existed"

3. **Luxury positioning without pretension**
   - Inside pool, outside pool, rooftop terraces
   - Best Moroccan cuisine (Reda's family recipes)
   - Quiet Tamraght vs. touristy Taghazout

4. **Co-creation element**
   - V4 makes it central, but all versions include participant input
   - Application process asks what you need
   - Group shapes the content

### Questions to Resolve:

1. **How niche do we go?**
   - **Broad (V1, V3):** Larger audience, safer positioning, but less differentiated
   - **Niche (V2):** ADHD-specific = smaller audience but 10% of entrepreneurs, underserved, strongest resonance
   - **Experimental (V4):** Appeals to early adopters, build-in-public crowd

2. **Primary surf narrative?**
   - **Therapy/healing (V1):** Burnout recovery, ocean as medicine
   - **ADHD flow training (V2):** Most unique positioning, science-backed ⭐
   - **Building metaphor (V3):** Read conditions, choose wave, commit
   - **Anchor activity (V4):** Guaranteed daily surf, flexible content around it

3. **Reda's prominence in story?**
   - All versions include him, but how central?
   - **Option A:** "Our friend Reda" (supporting character)
   - **Option B:** "Three friends" (equal partners)
   - **My take:** Keep as "our friend" — makes you/Iwo the main characters

4. **Tone preference?**
   - Empathetic/vulnerable (V1)
   - Knowing/insider (V2) ⭐
   - Ambitious/energetic (V3)
   - Transparent/experimental (V4)

### Testing Strategy:

**If we can only pick ONE for landing page:**
- **My recommendation:** V2 (ADHD angle with surf as therapy)
- **Why:**
  - Most differentiated positioning (no one else doing "surf therapy for ADHD entrepreneurs")
  - Backed by neuroscience (we researched this)
  - Underserved market (10% of entrepreneurs = large enough)
  - Strongest surf integration (flow state training)
  - "47 tabs open" hook is instantly relatable

**If we create variations:**
- **A/B test:** V2 (ADHD) vs. V3 (Builder)
- **Why:** V2 = niche depth with strong science backing, V3 = broader appeal with momentum metaphor

**For social media:**
- **LinkedIn:** Version 2 hook + Version 1 story (vulnerable + specific)
- **Instagram/TikTok:** Version 4 approach (build in public, show Reda's riad, experimental vibe)
- **Content series:** Document surf sessions, show workshop structure, feature Reda
