# Narrative Starters - Draft Versions
**Created:** November 12, 2024
**Purpose:** 4 versions to review with Iwo on Friday
**Target:** Founders, ADHD entrepreneurs, remote workers, biohackers
**Deadline:** Send to Iwo Thursday

---

## VERSION 1: FOUNDER BURNOUT ANGLE
**Tone:** Empathetic, understanding, renewal-focused
**Target:** Burned-out founders who feel isolated

### The Narrative:

Last year, we both hit the same wall.

Iwo was running on fumes after years of building. I was drowning in productivity hacks that didn't actually work. We realized something: the loneliness of building isn't about being alone—it's about being surrounded by people who don't get it.

So we booked flights to Morocco. Found a beautiful riad in Tamraght, away from the chaos. Spent a week surfing, talking, and rebuilding our systems from scratch. No bullshit networking. No forced positivity. Just two founders who actually understood each other.

It changed everything.

Now we're inviting 20 people to join us. Founders, creators, builders—people who are tired of pretending they have it all figured out.

**Here's what we're building together:**
- Build your AI-powered "second brain" (actual systems, not theory)
- Connect with peers who speak your language
- Surf, breathe, and remember why you started

This isn't a typical retreat. You'll help shape what happens. We'll ask what you need. The group decides the focus.

**Applications open now.** Limited to 20 spots. We're vetting for fit, not credentials.

Not everyone will be accepted. But if you're nodding your head right now, you're probably our people.

**→ Apply here** [Interactive form with AI matching]

*P.S. Tamraght is a slower, more authentic alternative to touristy Taghazout. Think: Berber fishing village, world-class surf, and people who actually want to connect.*

## VERSION 2: ADHD/NEURODIVERGENT ANGLE
**Tone:** Knowing, insider, "finally, people who get it"
**Target:** ADHD entrepreneurs, neurodivergent founders

### The Narrative:

If you're reading this, you probably have 47 tabs open right now.

We do too.

I'm Michał. My brain moves faster than my systems can keep up. I've tried every productivity framework designed for neurotypical people. They don't work.

Iwo gets it. His ADHD brain is why he's great at building—and why traditional "focus" advice feels like a foreign language.

Here's what we learned: **ADHD entrepreneurs don't need to fix their brains. We need systems designed FOR our brains.**

That's why we're creating something different in Morocco.

**7 days in Tamraght with 20 neurodivergent founders:**
- Build your AI-powered second brain (designed for ADHD brains)
- Learn from peers who actually think like you
- Surf therapy (yes, it's real—flow states on water)
- No neurotypical "just focus harder" bullshit

**The vibe:** Short, intense workshops. Plenty of break time. Outdoor movement. Real conversations with people who jump between topics too.

**The community:** We're vetting for founders and creators who are neurodivergent, ADHD, or just wired differently. You know who you are.

**Limited to 20 people.** Applications required. We want to create the group you've been looking for—the people who finally get it.

**→ Apply here** [Tell us about your brain, your business, what you need]

*Stats: 10% of entrepreneurs have ADHD vs. 4% of general population. You're not broken. You're just surrounded by the wrong people.*

## VERSION 3: BUILDER/CREATOR ANGLE
**Tone:** Ambitious, energetic, optimistic, action-oriented
**Target:** High-output creators, serial builders, productivity enthusiasts

### The Narrative:

Too many ideas. Not enough systems.

Sound familiar?

I'm Michał. I build things. So does Iwo. We're the kind of people who have three side projects, five half-finished courses, and a notes app that's basically a graveyard of brilliant ideas.

The problem isn't ideas. It's capture. It's prioritization. It's building a system that actually keeps up with how fast our brains move.

**We cracked it using AI + second brain methodology.** Now we want to show you how—in Morocco, with 20 ambitious builders.

**What we're building together (7 days, Tamraght):**

**Systems:**
- Build your AI-powered second brain from scratch
- Capture → Process → Execute (actual workflow, not theory)
- Habit design for high-output creators

**Community:**
- 20 builders who operate at your speed
- Hot seat sessions for your biggest bottleneck
- Peer accountability that actually works

**Balance:**
- Surf (flow state training on water)
- Ocean, sunsets, real conversations
- No burnout culture. Strategic rest.

**This is for you if:**
- You have more ideas than time
- Traditional productivity advice feels too slow
- You want systems, not motivation
- You're building something that matters

**Limited to 20 people.** We're selecting for ambition, not achievement. Applications open.

**→ Apply here** [Interactive form: What are you building? What's your bottleneck?]

*First cohort. Founding members. Help us shape what this becomes.*

## VERSION 4: CO-CREATION/EXPERIMENTAL ANGLE
**Tone:** Collaborative, transparent, experimental, invitational
**Target:** People who want agency, hate generic solutions

### The Narrative:

We're building a retreat. You can help design it.

Here's the honest truth: Iwo and I have been to enough "founder retreats" to know what's wrong with them.

They're generic. One-size-fits-all. You pay €1,500 to sit through workshops you didn't ask for, led by people who don't know your actual problems.

**So we're doing something different.**

We have a beautiful riad in Tamraght, Morocco. We have a network of experts (AI, ADHD, productivity, entrepreneurship). We have surf, yoga, and sunshine locked in.

**What we DON'T have:** A rigid agenda that ignores what you actually need.

**That's where you come in.**

**Here's how this works:**

**1. You apply** → Tell us what you're struggling with
   - Building AI systems for your work?
   - Managing ADHD as a founder?
   - Creating peer accountability?
   - Something else entirely?

**2. We match people** → AI-powered form finds common needs
   - 20 people with overlapping challenges
   - Diverse backgrounds, shared struggles
   - Curated for chemistry

**3. We co-create the agenda** → Group decides focus areas
   - Vote on workshop topics
   - Request specific experts
   - Shape the experience together

**The foundation (locked in):**
- 7 days, Tamraght, Morocco
- Surf + yoga + outdoor activities
- Beautiful riad, great food
- Expert facilitators on call

**The content (flexible):**
- Designed based on YOUR needs
- No bullshit filler sessions
- Every workshop is something the group requested

**This is an experiment.** We're building in public. You're not a customer—you're a co-creator.

**€1,500 for founding members.** Limited to 20 spots.

**→ Apply here** [Interactive form: What do you need? What will you bring?]

*P.S. If this works, we'll do it again. You'll help shape the next one too.*

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FRIDAY DISCUSSION

### Strongest Elements to Combine:

1. **Opening from V2:** "If you're reading this, you probably have 47 tabs open" (most engaging hook)
2. **Founder story from V1:** Authentic, relatable journey
3. **Systems promise from V3:** Concrete, actionable outcome
4. **Co-creation mechanism from V4:** Unique differentiator

### Questions to Resolve:

1. **How niche do we go?**
   - Broad (V1, V3) = larger audience, less differentiation
   - Niche (V2, V4) = smaller audience, stronger resonance

2. **Tone preference?**
   - Empathetic/gentle (V1)
   - Knowing/insider (V2)
   - Ambitious/energetic (V3)
   - Transparent/experimental (V4)

3. **Primary value proposition?**
   - Peer support/community (V1, V2)
   - Systems/skills (V3)
   - Agency/co-creation (V4)

4. **Application process emphasis?**
   - All versions mention it, but V4 makes it most central
   - Do we lead with selectivity or inclusivity?

### Testing Strategy:

**If we can only pick ONE for landing page:**
- **My recommendation:** V2 (ADHD angle)
- **Why:** Most specific differentiation, underserved market, strongest community signal

**If we create variations:**
- **A/B test:** V2 (ADHD) vs. V3 (Builder)
- **Why:** V2 = niche depth, V3 = broader appeal, both have strong hooks

**For social media:**
- **Short version of V2** for LinkedIn
- **Behind-the-scenes from V4** for Instagram/TikTok (build in public)

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Friday with Iwo:**
   - Read all 4 versions
   - Identify which hooks resonate
   - Decide on primary angle
   - Combine best elements

2. **After selection:**
   - Refine chosen version (150 words max for landing page hero)
   - Create longer version for "About" page
   - Develop social media adaptations
   - Build interactive application form

3. **Visual pairing:**
   - Each version needs different imagery
   - V1: Intimate, two people talking
   - V2: Energetic, slightly chaotic (ADHD aesthetic)
   - V3: Clean, modern, systems-focused
   - V4: Behind-the-scenes, work-in-progress
