# Narrative Feedback & Alternative Proposals
**Date:** November 12, 2024
**Analyzing:** Your 3 drafted narratives

---

## YOUR ANGLE 1: Neurodivergency Analysis

### What's Working ✅
- **Hook is strong:** "The ocean gives you clarity. AI gives you speed. Learn both in 7 days." - Clear, contrasting, actionable
- **Direct benefit statement** in first lines
- **Neurodivergent-friendly** positioning is clear
- **"Extraordinary individuals"** feels elevating

### What Needs Work ⚠️

**Missing Elements:**
- ❌ No three friends story (Michał, Iwo, Reda)
- ❌ No location details (Tamraght, Reda's riad, luxury specifics)
- ❌ No surfing benefits beyond "clarity"
- ❌ No emotional depth or transformation promise

**Phrasing Issues:**
- "Turn your ADHD into a superpower" → Overused cliché, feels like every ADHD coach says this
- "SURF/AI camp" → Sounds like summer camp, not premium experience (also inconsistent with "retreat")
- "Maybe you want to..." → Weakens commitment, sounds uncertain
- "Care to share them with us" → Too passive, weak CTA
- "It would be amazing to have you on board" → Feels like an afterthought

**Structural Issues:**
- Description jumps around (ocean → AI → we are building → maybe you want → ideas)
- No flow or story arc
- Questions feel scattered, not purposeful

### Specific Improvements Needed

**Reframe "ADHD superpower":**
❌ "Turn your ADHD into a superpower"
✅ "Build systems that work WITH your ADHD brain, not against it"
✅ "Your ADHD isn't broken. Your tools are."
✅ "What if your scattered focus was actually pattern recognition?"

**Strengthen CTA:**
❌ "Care to share them with us so that we can build something unique together?"
✅ "Share what you need. Help us build this together. [Apply Now]"
✅ "Tell us what you're looking for → [Shape the First Cohort]"

**Add specificity:**
- Where is this? (Tamraght, Morocco)
- When is this?
- What's the space like? (Reda's new luxury riad)
- Who are we? (Three friends story)

---

## YOUR ANGLE 2: "THE TAMRAGHT EXPERIMENT" Analysis

### What's Working ✅
- **Hook is solid:** Testing something, specific components, brand-new luxury riad
- **Experimental framing** lowers pressure, invites participation
- **Co-creation** is crystal clear
- **Questions engage** the reader
- **"Let's build!"** has energy

### What Needs Work ⚠️

**Tone Issues:**
- "We do not know. But hell, we really want to find out." → Too casual/flippant for €1,500 investment
- Mixed formal/informal ("do not" vs "hell")
- Lacks confidence

**Missing Elements:**
- ❌ Who is "we"? (Three friends story completely absent)
- ❌ Why Tamraght specifically? (vs. Taghazout, other spots)
- ❌ What makes Reda's riad special? (just says "luxury space")
- ❌ No transformation promise (what do people get?)
- ❌ No scarcity/urgency (first cohort, limited spots)

**Naming Inconsistency:**
- "SURF/AI retreat" → Retreat wasn't your chosen word in other angles

**CTA Issues:**
- "Share your thoughts and join the waiting list" → Two actions, unclear priority
- Waiting list ≠ application (passive vs. active)

### Specific Improvements Needed

**Strengthen tone:**
❌ "We do not know. But hell, we really want to find out."
✅ "We have a hypothesis. Help us test it."
✅ "We're not sure what happens. That's exactly why we're inviting 20 curious founders to find out."
✅ "The best experiments need the right people. Are you in?"

**Add the founders:**
- Who is behind this? (Michał, Iwo, Reda)
- Why are you qualified to lead this?
- What's your connection to Morocco/surf/AI?

**Paint the place:**
❌ "brand-new luxury Moroccan riad"
✅ "Reda's brand-new luxury riad in Tamraght—inside pool, outside pool, rooftop terraces overlooking Morocco's best surf breaks"

**Clarify CTA:**
❌ "Share your thoughts and join the waiting list"
✅ "Answer 3 questions → Join First Cohort"
✅ "Apply now. First 20 spots only."

---

## YOUR ANGLE 3: "THREE FRIENDS" Analysis

### What's Working ✅
- **Story is compelling:** The timeline (2021 → 2024), the evolution
- **Natural alignment** feels authentic
- **Personal connection** is clear
- **Co-creation invitation** is present

### What Needs Work ⚠️

**Critical Missing:**
- ❌ **NO HOOK!** (You noted this - it's a dealbreaker)

**Tone/Phrasing Issues:**
- "Sometimes things align, and the universe just tells us to do stuff" → Too woo-woo, undermines credibility
- "fell in love with the place" → Vague, cliché
- "The math is simple" → Doesn't actually simplify anything, confuses
- "tech/ex-tech" → Confusing target (are you targeting people who LEFT tech? Just tech?)

**Factual Questions:**
- "biggest luxury surf riad in the Taghazout area" → Is this accurate? Can you verify? Bold claim needs proof

**Missing Elements:**
- ❌ No transformation promise (what do people gain?)
- ❌ No surfing benefits described
- ❌ No AI benefits beyond "skills"
- ❌ No emotional hook
- ❌ Repeats exact same questions as Angle 2 (feels copy-paste)

### Specific Improvements Needed

**Need a strong hook:**
Option A: "Three friends. One new riad. Your co-designed retreat."
Option B: "In 2021, we met on a surf trip. In 2024, we're building something together."
Option C: "Michał. Iwo. Reda. Surf. AI. Morocco. You."

**Reframe the story opening:**
❌ "Sometimes things align, and the universe just tells us to do stuff."
✅ "In 2021, Michał and Iwo took their first Morocco surf trip. They met Reda. Three years of friendship later, the opportunity is obvious."
✅ "Some friendships change the trajectory. Ours led here."
✅ "2021: Two founders meet a local surfer. 2024: They're opening a retreat together."

**Clarify target:**
❌ "tech/ex-tech"
✅ "founders and builders"
✅ "tech entrepreneurs and creators"
✅ "people who build things (with or without code)"

**Don't repeat questions:**
- You asked the exact same 3 questions in Angle 2
- Either differentiate them or choose one angle that owns this approach

**Add transformation:**
- What changes in 7 days?
- What do people bring home?
- Why does this matter beyond a nice vacation?

## CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES (All 3 Angles)

### 1. Naming Inconsistency
- Angle 1: "SURF/AI camp"
- Angle 2: "SURF/AI retreat"
- Angle 3: "surf + AI retreat"

**Decision needed:** Pick ONE and stick with it. Options:
- "The Tamraght Experiment" (no need for SURF/AI)
- "Surf + AI Immersion"
- "The Founder's Week: Surf & AI"
- Just call it by location: "Tamraght 01"

### 2. Weak CTAs Throughout
Every ending feels rushed or passive:
- "Care to share them with us"
- "Share your thoughts and join the waiting list"
- "Share your desires and let's make them a reality"

**Better CTAs:**
- "Answer 3 questions → Shape the first cohort"
- "Apply now. 20 spots only. First come, first served."
- "Tell us what you need → [Start Application]"
- "Join the experiment → [Apply Here]"

### 3. Questions Repeated Verbatim
Angles 2 & 3 ask identical questions:
- "Which AI skills do you desire the most?"
- "What hands-on expertise does your business need right now?"
- "What kind of people you'd like to be around?"

**Options:**
a) Pick ONE angle to use these questions
b) Reframe them uniquely per angle
c) Make them more specific to each narrative

### 4. Missing Throughout: Urgency & Scarcity
None of the angles include:
- How many spots (20? 15?)
- When applications close
- When retreat happens
- "First cohort" emphasized enough
- Price transparency (€1,500)

### 5. Transformation Promise Unclear
None clearly state:
- What you'll have built by end (AI system? Surf skills? Network?)
- How you'll feel different
- What changes in your work/life

**Add to all:**
"By day 7, you'll have: [specific outcomes]"
"You'll leave with: [concrete deliverables]"

## MY RANKING OF YOUR 3 ANGLES

### 🥇 **ANGLE 2: "The Tamraght Experiment"**
**Why it's strongest:**
- Clearest co-creation angle
- Experimental framing is honest and inviting
- Most aligned with meta-narrative approach you wanted
- Easy to build content around ("documenting the experiment")

**What it needs:**
- Add the three friends story
- Paint Tamraght/riad in detail
- Fix tone ("hell" → more confident)
- Strengthen CTA
- Add urgency/scarcity

---

### 🥈 **ANGLE 3: "Three Friends"**
**Why it's second:**
- Story is compelling when told right
- Personal connection is differentiating
- Timeline creates narrative arc

**What it needs:**
- **HOOK! (Critical)**
- Rewrite opening (too woo-woo)
- Clarify target (tech/ex-tech is confusing)
- Don't repeat questions from Angle 2
- Add transformation promise

---

### 🥉 **ANGLE 1: Neurodivergency**
**Why it's third:**
- Too niche-specific for "discovery phase"
- Hook is good but rest falls apart
- "ADHD superpower" is cliché territory
- Missing all context (who, where, what, why)

**What it needs:**
- Complete restructure
- Add three friends story
- Add Tamraght details
- Reframe ADHD angle (avoid clichés)
- Much stronger CTA

## ALTERNATIVE NARRATIVE PROPOSALS

I'm proposing 3 NEW angles that fix the issues above:

---

## 🆕 ALTERNATIVE 1: "REDA'S RIAD OPENS"

### Hook
**"Our friend just opened the best surf riad in Tamraght. We're filling it with 20 builders for the first week."**

### Full Narrative

Our friend just opened the best surf riad in Tamraght.
We're filling it with 20 builders for the first week.

In 2021, Michał and Iwo took their first Morocco surf trip. Met Reda—a local surfer who grew up on these waves. Three years later, Reda's opening a luxury riad in Tamraght (the quieter village 15 minutes from Taghazout everyone will discover in 2 years).

The timing is perfect:
- Iwo now teaches AI to non-technical founders
- Michał bridges tech and hospitality
- Reda has the space we always wanted

**Here's what we're building for the first cohort:**

**Locked in:**
- Daily surf (coached by Reda, all levels welcome)
- Luxury base (inside pool, outside pool, rooftop terraces, incredible food)
- AI workshops (practical, non-technical, taught by Iwo)
- 7 days, 20 people, Tamraght

**Co-created by you:**
- Which AI skills matter most to your work?
- What transformation are you looking for?
- What kind of people do you want to connect with?

Your input shapes the program. First cohort = founding members.

**[Apply Here] → Answer 3 questions. First 20 spots.**

---

**Why this works:**
✅ Leads with Reda's riad (the unique asset)
✅ Three friends story is clear and natural
✅ Timeline creates anticipation (2021 → 2024)
✅ "First week" creates urgency
✅ "Quieter village... everyone will discover in 2 years" = insider positioning
✅ Clear structure (locked in vs. co-created)
✅ Strong CTA with action

---

## 🆕 ALTERNATIVE 2: "THE FOUNDER'S WEEK"

### Hook
**"What if you spent one week where the only distractions were waves, ideas, and 19 other builders?"**

### Full Narrative

What if you spent one week where the only distractions were waves, ideas, and 19 other builders?

No Slack. No meetings. No context-switching.
Just surf, AI tools, and deep conversations with people building real things.

We're testing this in Tamraght, Morocco.

**The setup:**
- Reda's brand-new luxury riad (just opened, you're among the first guests)
- World-class surf breaks (15 min from crowded Taghazout)
- Inside pool, outside pool, rooftop terraces
- The best Moroccan food you'll eat

**The structure:**
- Morning surf (coached, all levels—you'll catch waves)
- Afternoon workshops (AI tools for your actual work, taught by Iwo—non-technical)
- Evening conversations (builders helping builders)

**The customization:**
This is the first cohort. You help shape it.
Tell us what you need—we'll design the week around it.

**The outcome:**
You'll leave with:
- AI systems you'll actually use
- Surf skills you didn't have
- A network of 19 builders who get it
- Clarity on what you're building next

**7 days. 20 people. First cohort.**

**[Apply Now]** → Tell us what you're working on.

---

**Why this works:**
✅ Hook creates immediate visual (week of focus)
✅ Contrast (what's missing vs. what's there)
✅ "The Founder's Week" feels like a concept, not a product
✅ Reda introduced naturally
✅ Benefits clearly stated (leave with X)
✅ Co-creation embedded but not overwhelming
✅ Strong, simple CTA

---

## 🆕 ALTERNATIVE 3: "COHORT 01"

### Hook
**"We're inviting 20 people to Tamraght to test something: Can a week of surf + AI + peer learning change how you build?"**

### Full Narrative

We're inviting 20 people to Tamraght to test something:
Can a week of surf + AI + peer learning change how you build?

**The hypothesis:**
- Daily physical challenge (surfing) creates mental clarity
- Practical AI tools reduce cognitive load
- Peer learning with other builders accelerates insight
- Time away from chaos reveals what matters

**The setup:**
Michał, Iwo, and Reda (our friend who just opened a luxury surf riad in Morocco) are running the first experiment.

**The space:**
Tamraght—a quieter Berber village with world-class surf, 15 min from touristy Taghazout. Reda's brand-new riad: inside pool, outside pool, rooftop terraces, incredible Moroccan cuisine.

**The program (co-designed):**
We have the framework. You fill in the details.
- What AI skills do you need most?
- What challenges are you facing?
- What would make this week transformative for you?

First cohort shapes what this becomes.

**The ask:**
Apply. Tell us what you're building and what you need.
If we're good fit, you're in.

**Cohort 01 starts [Date]. 20 spots. Applications close [Date].**

**[Start Application]**

---

**Why this works:**
✅ "Cohort 01" branding is clean and scalable
✅ Hypothesis framing is scientific, credible
✅ Three friends introduced efficiently
✅ Tamraght positioning clear (quieter alternative)
✅ Co-design is embedded in structure
✅ Timeline creates urgency
✅ "If we're good fit, you're in" = selective, not desperate

## MY RECOMMENDATION

### Use Alternative 1: "Reda's Riad Opens" for PRIMARY NARRATIVE

**Why:**
1. **Leads with your unique asset** (Reda's brand-new riad)
2. **Story flows naturally** (2021 meet → 2024 opening)
3. **Creates urgency** ("first week", "just opened")
4. **Insider positioning** (discover Tamraght before others)
5. **All three friends have clear roles**
6. **Co-creation is present but not overwhelming**

### Combine with elements from Alternative 3 ("Cohort 01")

**Specifically:**
- Use "Cohort 01" branding/naming
- Add specific dates and deadlines
- Include "applications close [date]" urgency

### Final Hybrid Version:

**Hook:**
"Our friend just opened the best surf riad in Tamraght. We're filling it with 20 builders for Cohort 01."

**[Rest of Alternative 1 narrative]**

**Closing:**
"Cohort 01: [Date range]. Applications close [Date].
20 spots. First come, first shaped.

[Apply Here] → Answer 3 questions."

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Choose your narrative approach:**
   - Your Angle 2 (needs work) OR
   - My Alternative 1 (ready to go) OR
   - Hybrid of both

2. **Fix the CTAs across all materials:**
   - Remove "share your thoughts"
   - Add specific actions ("Apply Now", "Answer 3 Questions")
   - Include urgency (dates, limited spots)

3. **Add these details everywhere:**
   - Three friends introduction
   - Tamraght vs. Taghazout positioning
   - Reda's riad luxury specifics
   - Transformation promise (what people leave with)
   - Timeline/dates/urgency

4. **Pick ONE naming convention:**
   - "The Tamraght Experiment: Cohort 01" OR
   - "Cohort 01: Tamraght" OR
   - "The Founder's Week: Tamraght" OR
   - Just "Tamraght 01"

5. **Don't repeat questions verbatim** across different angles
   - Either commit to one angle or differentiate the questions
