# Claude Code 1:1 Implementation Session
## Transform Your Work in One Afternoon - Sales Overview

---

## The Offer

**From "I'll try Claude Code someday" to "My Claude Code is running" in one focused session.**

Join Iwo Szapar for a 1:1 "second brain" implementation session. Two hours to a working AI system built for your actual work—not generic templates, just your workflows.

**Investment**: $750
**Availability**: Limited to 5 slots per month
**Format**: Hybrid (async prep + live implementation)

---

## The Backstory

Morocco. October 2024. Between surf sessions, consultants, marketers, and product managers cornered me: *"Show us how you actually use Claude Code for work. We want to work smarter, not harder."*

I ran small group sessions. Everyone wanted it customized to their world.

**The discovery**: The power isn't in teaching Claude Code features. It's in implementing YOUR specific workflows together. Live. No "figure it out later" homework.

## The Unique Value Proposition

### Why This Works (When Other Training Doesn't)

**Problem with Traditional AI Training**:
- Generic demos of features you'll never use
- Homework you never complete
- Templates that don't match your work
- Weeks of "figuring it out later"

**Our Approach**:
1. **Async prep** ensures we use YOUR actual work as examples
2. **Live implementation** means you leave with WORKING systems
3. **Your workflows** not generic case studies
4. **Hands-on building** not passive watching

### The Transformation

**Before**:
- Re-explain context to AI 10+ times per week
- Copy-paste between tools for 30+ minutes daily
- Manual workflows eating 10-15 hours weekly
- Knowledge trapped in your head

**After**:
- AI remembers your project context permanently
- Tools connected directly (no copy-paste)
- Workflows trigger automatically on keywords
- Knowledge lives in your "second brain" repository

### ROI Calculation

**Time Investment**:
- 2 hours async prep
- 2 hours live session
- Total: 4 hours

**Weekly Time Savings** (conservative):
- Context re-explanation: 2 hours saved
- Tool switching/copy-paste: 3 hours saved
- Repetitive task automation: 5 hours saved
- **Total: 10 hours/week = 40 hours/month**

**Break-Even**: If your time is worth $75/hour, you break even in **1 week**

**Compounding Value**: Your system gets smarter over time as you add more context and skills

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Pre-Session Questions

**Q: Do I need coding experience?**
A: No. Everything is plain English and markdown files. If you can create folders and text files, you can do this.

**Q: What if I don't know which workflows to automate?**
A: That's what the async prep is for. Iwo helps you identify the highest-value opportunities before the session.

**Q: What tools do I need?**
A: Claude Pro subscription ($20/month), a computer, and 2 hours of focused time. We'll handle the rest together.

**Q: What if my workflow is unique to my industry?**
A: Even better. We customize everything to YOUR specific work. No generic templates.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What if I get stuck after the session?**
A: You get 2 weeks of email support plus session recording for reference. Most people don't need help because everything is working before you leave.

**Q: Can I add more tools/agents later?**
A: Yes. Once you understand the pattern, you can extend your setup independently. The session gives you the foundation.

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Yes. We implement security-first practices: read-only permissions initially, approval workflows for sensitive operations, and audit logging.

**Q: What if Claude Code updates break my setup?**
A: Claude Code is stable and backwards-compatible. If breaking changes occur, you get free update assistance.

### Value Questions

**Q: Why not just watch a tutorial?**
A: Tutorials are generic. This is YOUR workflows built together. You walk out with a working system, not homework.

**Q: What if I don't save 10 hours/week?**
A: Even saving 3-4 hours/week means ROI in 3 weeks. Most clients report 8-15 hours saved weekly.

**Q: Can I share this with my team?**
A: The setup is yours. You can share your repository structure and skills. For team training, ask about group rates.

**Q: Is there ongoing cost after the session?**
A: Only Claude Pro ($20/month). No recurring fees. Your setup is yours forever.
