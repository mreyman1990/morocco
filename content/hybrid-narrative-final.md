# FINAL NARRATIVE - Hybrid Version
**Combining:** Narrative 1 (Three Friends Story) + Narrative 3 (AI Focus & Experimental)
**Date:** November 12, 2024

---

## CURRENT HYBRID (Based on Your Feedback):

### HOOK:

Three friends. One new riad. Your co-designed, invite-only SURF+AI Immersion.

### DESCRIPTION:

Sometimes things just align.

In 2022, two lads went for their first surf trip to Morocco and met Reda, who grew up on these waves. They fell in love with the vibe, the people, and what the place has to offer.

Three years and many surf trips later…

→ Iwo teaches AI to non-technical people
→ Michał left tech and entered the hospitality industry
→ Reda opened the biggest luxury surf riad in the Taghazout/Tamraght area

The opportunity is obvious.

**We're launching an invite-only SURF+AI Immersion for founders and builders** — and you can help shape what it becomes.

**HERE'S WHAT'S LOCKED IN:**

→ **Daily surf** (all levels welcome, coached by Reda) and yoga
→ **Luxury base** (inside + outside pools, en-suite rooms, rooftop terraces)
→ **Build your AI-powered "Second Brain"** with Iwo (practical, non-technical)
→ **Moroccan culture immersion** (food, places, nature — Reda's your guide)

**HERE'S WHAT YOU CO-CREATE:**

Tell us what you need your Second Brain to do:
→ Speed up your work and automate repetitive tasks?
→ Organize your ideas and manage ADHD/neurodivergent thinking?
→ Help you build your product faster with AI collaboration?
→ Something else entirely?

**Your input shapes the program.** We'll design the week around what matters most to the group.

The first cohort is invite-only. 20 carefully selected founders and builders.

**Apply. Tell us what you're building and what you need. If we're a good fit, you're in.**

Let's surf, build, and create together.

## WHAT CHANGED FROM ORIGINALS:

### From Narrative 1 (Three Friends) - KEPT:
✅ Full story with timeline (2022 → 2025)
✅ Three friends alignment narrative
✅ Personal, human connection
✅ "Locked in vs. Co-created" structure

### From Narrative 3 (Experiment) - ADDED:
✅ Clear AI focus (moved from vague "AI training" to specific "Second Brain")
✅ Experimental/co-creation emphasis
✅ Application process ("If we're a good fit, you're in")
✅ Crew details at bottom

### From Narrative 2 (Neurodivergency) - INTEGRATED:
✅ ADHD/neurodivergent mentioned as ONE use case for Second Brain
✅ Not the main angle, but acknowledged

### NEW ADDITIONS per feedback:
✅ **"Invite-only" appears 3 times** (hook, description, details)
✅ **"Second Brain" is the outcome** (not "AI workshops")
✅ **Clear use cases for Second Brain:**
   - Speed up work
   - Organize ideas/manage ADHD
   - Build product faster
   - Open to other needs

## SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS:

### 1. Strengthen Opening (Remove Vague Lines)

**Current:**
```
Sometimes things just align.
[story]
The opportunity is obvious.
```

**Option A - Cut philosophy, start with story:**
```
In 2022, two lads went for their first surf trip to Morocco and met Reda...
[Skip "sometimes things align" and "opportunity is obvious"]
```

**Option B - Stronger philosophy:**
```
Three years ago, we met on a surf trip. Now we're building something together.
```

### 2. Make "Invite-Only" Even More Prominent

**Add to hook:**
```
HOOK:
Three friends. One new riad.
Your invite-only, co-designed SURF+AI Immersion.

[First cohort: 20 spots only]
```

### 3. Expand Second Brain Description

**Current:** "Build your AI-powered 'Second Brain' with Iwo (practical, non-technical)"

**More descriptive:**
```
→ Build your AI-powered Second Brain with Iwo
   (capture every idea, organize chaos, automate repetitive work —
   practical, non-technical, designed for founders)
```

### 4. Add Outcome Clarity

**Add before DETAILS:**
```
BY DAY 7, YOU'LL HAVE:
→ Your AI-powered Second Brain (built, tested, working)
→ Surf skills you didn't have before
→ Network of 19 founders who get it
→ Clarity on what you're building next
```

### 5. Strengthen CTA

**Current:** "Let's surf, build, and create together."

## QUICK REFERENCE - Key Changes Summary:

**Per your feedback:**
1. ✅ Combined Narratives 1 + 3 (story + AI focus)
2. ✅ "Second Brain" is the main AI promise (not "AI workshops")
3. ✅ Neurodivergency mentioned as one use case (not main angle)
4. ✅ "Invite-only" appears prominently (3+ times)
5. ✅ Clear what Second Brain can do (speed, organize, build, ADHD)

**Still to decide:**
- Keep or cut "Sometimes things just align"?
- Keep or cut "The opportunity is obvious"?
- Add "By Day 7" section or keep it implied?
- How aggressive on the CTA?

**Next steps:**
1. Choose between current hybrid or fully polished version
2. Fix any remaining language issues
3. Finalize for launch
