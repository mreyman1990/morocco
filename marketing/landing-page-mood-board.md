### **Real vs Generic:**
✅ These sources are ALL from real Moroccan riads, retreat operators, and yoga/surf businesses
✅ You're sourcing from Instagram accounts with thousands of followers (real community)
✅ Images are from Booking.com, TripAdvisor, Airbnb (verified guest & professional photos)
✅ NOT generic stock photography - these are authentic retreat environments

**Quality Promise:** Every image source is from an actual business, retreat operator, or Instagram account with a real retreat community in Taghazout/Tamraght.

**Questions:**
- Which Instagram accounts should we reach out to for specific high-res photos?
- Should we contact Riad Dlim for permission to use their professional photos?
- Timeline for having mockup ready with actual images?
